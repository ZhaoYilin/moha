Installation
************

We provide three ways to install PySCF package.

Installation with pip
=====================

This is the recommended way to install PySCF::

  $ pip install pyscf

Pypi provides a precompiled PySCF code (python wheel) which works on almost all
Linux systems, and most of Mac OS X systems, and the ubuntu subsystems on Windows 10.

Note we observed that our precompiled python wheels sometimes does not work with
certain version of Python (python-3.4 and python-3.5).  If you're using mac OS X
with python-3.4 or python-3.5, pip may execute the setup.py file in the source
code and it may be terminated due to an error of library path of BLAS library.
BLAS library is required to install PySCF library.  The installation script can
detect the installed BLAS libraries in the system and choose one for the
program.  If BLAS library is existed but wasn't found by the installation
script, you can specify the BLAS library either through the environment
``LDFLAGS``, e.g. ``LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/blas -lblas" pip install pyscf`` or the
environment variable ``PYSCF_INC_DIR``, e.g.
``PYSCF_INC_DIR=/path/to/blas:/path/to/other/lib pip install`` to tell the
installation script which BLAS libraries to link against.
Another issue of the installation script you may get is that pyscf.dft module is
not working.  pyscf.dft module requires the exchange-correlation functional
library ``libxc`` which was not yet available in the PyPI repository. To enable
pyscf.dft module, you can download and manually compile libxc library and set
the environment variable ``PYSCF_INC_DIR``, e.g. ``export PYSCF_INC_DIR=/path/to/libxc``
before calling ``pip install`` command.  Libxc library can be found in
http://octopus-code.org/wiki/Libxc:download.  When compiling the libxc library,
you need to add --enable-shared flag.


Installation with conda
=======================

If you have `Conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ 
(or `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads#linux>`_)
environment, PySCF package can be installed through Conda cloud::

  $ conda install -c pyscf pyscf


Manual installation from github repo
====================================

Manual installation requires `cmake <http://www.cmake.org>`_,
`numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
and `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_ libraries.
You can download the latest PySCF (or the development branch) from github::

  $ git clone https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf
  $ cd pyscf
  $ git checkout dev  # optional if you'd like to try out the development branch

Build the C extensions in :file:`pyscf/lib`::

  $ cd pyscf/lib
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

This will automatically download the analytical GTO integral library `libcint
<https://github.com/sunqm/libcint.git>`_ and the DFT exchange correlation
functional libraries `libxc <http://www.tddft.org/programs/Libxc>`_ and `xcfun
<https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun.git>`_.  Finally, to make Python find
the :code:`pyscf` package, add the top-level :code:`pyscf` directory (not
the :code:`pyscf/pyscf` subdirectory) to :code:`PYTHONPATH`.  For example, if
:code:`pyscf` is installed in ``/opt``, :code:`PYTHONPATH` should be like::

  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/pyscf:$PYTHONPATH

To ensure the installation is successful, start a Python shell, and type::

  >>> import pyscf

For Mac OS X/macOS, you may get an import error if your OS X/macOS version is
10.11 or newer::

    OSError: dlopen(xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib, 6): Library not loaded: libcint.3.0.dylib
    Referenced from: xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib
    Reason: unsafe use of relative rpath libcint.3.0.dylib in xxx/pyscf/pyscf/lib/libcgto.dylib with restricted binary

This is caused by the incorrect RPATH.  Script
``pyscf/lib/_runme_to_fix_dylib_osx10.11.sh`` in ``pyscf/lib`` directory can be
used to fix this problem::
 
    cd pyscf/lib
    sh _runme_to_fix_dylib_osx10.11.sh


.. note::

  RPATH has been built in the dynamic library.  This may cause library loading
  error on some systems.  You can run ``pyscf/lib/_runme_to_remove_rpath.sh`` to
  remove the rpath code from the library head.  Another workaround is to set
  ``-DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=1`` and ``-DCMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH=0`` in cmake command line.
  When the RPATH was removed, you need to add ``pyscf/lib`` and
  ``pyscf/lib/deps/lib`` in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.

Last, it's recommended to set a scratch directory for PySCF.  The default scratch
directory is controlled by environment variable :code:`PYSCF_TMPDIR`.  If it's
not specified, the system temporary directory :code:`TMPDIR` will be used as the
scratch directory.


Installation without network
============================

If you have problems to download the external libraries on your computer, you can
manually build the libraries, as shown in the following instructions.  First,
you need to install libcint, libxc or xcfun libraries.
`libcint cint3 branch <https://github.com/sunqm/libcint/tree/cint3>`_
and `xcfun stable-1.x branch <https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun/tree/stable-1.x>`_
are required by PySCF.  They can be downloaded from github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunqm/libcint.git
    $ cd libcint
    $ git checkout origin/cint3
    $ cd .. && tar czf libcint.tar.gz libcint

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunqm/xcfun.git
    $ cd xcfun
    $ git checkout origin/stable-1.x
    $ cd .. && tar czf xcfun.tar.gz xcfun

libxc-3.* can be found in http://octopus-code.org/wiki/Main_Page or
`here <http://sunqm.net/pyscf/files/src/libxc-3.0.0.tar.gz>`_.
Assuming ``/opt`` is the place where these libraries will be installed, these
packages should be compiled with the flags::

    $ tar xvzf libcint.tar.gz
    $ cd libcint
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DWITH_F12=1 -DWITH_RANGE_COULOMB=1 -DWITH_COULOMB_ERF=1 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR:PATH=lib ..
    $ make && make install

    $ tar xvzf libxc-3.0.0.tar.gz
    $ cd libxc-0.0.0
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=/opt --libdir=/opt/lib --enable-shared --disable-fortran LIBS=-lm
    $ make && make install

    $ tar xvzf xcfun.tar.gz
    $ cd xcfun
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -DXC_MAX_ORDER=3 -DXCFUN_ENABLE_TESTS=0 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR:PATH=lib ..
    $ make && make install

Next compile PySCF::

    $ cd pyscf/pyscf/lib
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_LIBCINT=0 -DBUILD_LIBXC=0 -DBUILD_XCFUN=0 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt ..
    $ make

Finally update the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment for Python interpreter.


.. _installing_blas:

Using optimized BLAS
====================

The default installation tries to find BLAS libraries automatically. This
automated setup script may link the code to slow BLAS libraries.  You can
compile the package with other BLAS vendors to improve performance, for example
the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), which can provide 10x speedup in many
modules::

  $ cd pyscf/lib/build
  $ cmake -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq ..
  $ make

When linking the program to MKL library, for some MKL versions, cmake may have
problems to find the correct MKL libraries.  Setting ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to
include the MKL dynamic libraries sometimes can help cmake to find the MKL
libraries, e.g.::

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2018/linux/mkl/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you are using Anaconda as your Python-side platform, you can link PySCF
to the MKL library coming with Anaconda package::

  $ export MKLROOT=/path/to/anaconda2
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MKLROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ cd pyscf/lib/build
  $ cmake -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq ..
  $ make

You can link to other BLAS libraries by setting ``BLA_VENDOR``, eg
``BLA_VENDOR=ATLAS``, ``BLA_VENDOR=IBMESSL``, ``BLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS`` (requiring cmake-3.6).
Please refer to `cmake mannual <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.6/module/FindBLAS.html>`_
for more details of the use of ``FindBLAS`` macro.

If the cmake ``BLA_VENDOR`` cannot find the right BLAS library as you expected,
you can assign the libraries to the variable ``BLAS_LIBRARIES`` in
:file:`lib/CMakeLists.txt`::

  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_intel_lp64.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_sequential.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so")
  set(BLAS_LIBRARIES "${BLAS_LIBRARIES};/path/to/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so")

.. note::
  MKL library may lead to an OSError at runtime:
  ``OSError: ... mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so: undefined symbol: ownLastTriangle_64fc``
  or ``MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.``.
  It can be solved by preloading MKL core library with:
  ``export LD_PRELOAD=$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/libmkl_avx.so:$MKLROOT/lib/intel64/libmkl_core.so``


.. _installing_qcint:

Using optimized integral library
================================

The default integral library used by PySCF is
libcint (https://github.com/sunqm/libcint).  This integral library was
implemented in the model that ensures the compatibility on various high
performance computer systems.  For X86-64 platforms, libcint library has an
efficient counterpart Qcint (https://github.com/sunqm/qcint)
which is heavily optimized against X86 SIMD instructions (AVX-512/AVX2/AVX/SSE3).
To replace the default libcint library with qcint library, edit the URL
of the integral library in lib/CMakeLists.txt file::

  ExternalProject_Add(libcint
     GIT_REPOSITORY
     https://github.com/sunqm/qcint.git
     ...


Cmake config file
=================
Cmake options can be saved in a config file ``pyscf/lib/cmake.arch.inc``.
Settings in this config file will be automatically loaded and overwritten the
default cmake options during compilation.  For example, you can put
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` in this config file to include advanced compiler optimization
flags::

  set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -ffast-math -mtune=native -march=native")

Other settings and variables and flags can all be put in this config file::

  set(ENABLE_XCFUN Off)
  set(WITH_F12 Off)

Some examples of platform specific configurations can be found in directory
``pyscf/lib/cmake_arch_config``.


.. _installing_plugin:

Plugins
=======

nao
---
:mod:`pyscf/nao` module includes the basic functions of numerical atomic orbitals
(NAO) and the (nao based) TDDFT methods.  This module was contributed by Marc
Barbry and Peter Koval.  You can enable this module with a cmake flag::

    $ cmake -DENABLE_NAO=1 ..

More information of the compilation can be found in :file:`pyscf/lib/nao/README.md`.

DMRG solver
-----------
Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) implementations Block
(http://chemists.princeton.edu/chan/software/block-code-for-dmrg) and
CheMPS2 (http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html)
are efficient DMRG solvers for ab initio quantum chemistry problem.
`Installing Block <http://sanshar.github.io/Block/build.html>`_ requires
C++11 compiler.  If C++11 is not supported by your compiler, you can
register and download the precompiled Block binary from
http://chemists.princeton.edu/chan/software/block-code-for-dmrg.
Before using the Block or CheMPS2, you need create a config file
future/dmrgscf/settings.py  (as shown by settings.py.example) to store
the path where the DMRG solver was installed.

FCIQMC
------
NECI (https://github.com/ghb24/NECI_STABLE) is FCIQMC code developed by
George Booth and Ali Alavi.  PySCF has an interface to call FCIQMC
solver NECI.  To use NECI, you need create a config file
future/fciqmc/settings.py to store the path where NECI was installed.

Libxc
-----
By default, building PySCF will automatically download and install
`Libxc 3.0.0 <http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc:download>`_.
:mod:`pyscf.dft.libxc` module provided a general interface to access Libxc functionals.

Xcfun
-----
By default, building PySCF will automatically download and install
latest xcfun code from https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun.
:mod:`pyscf.dft.xcfun` module provided a general interface to access Libxc
functionals.

XianCI
------
XianCI is a spin-adapted MRCI program.  "Bingbing Suo" <bsuo@nwu.edu.cn>
is the main developer of XianCI program.
