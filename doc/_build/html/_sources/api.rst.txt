API Reference
=============

This detailed reference lists all the classes and functions contained in the package.
If you are just looking to get started, read the :doc:`/tutorial/index` first.

The :class:`.Lattice` describes the unit cell of a crystal, while the :class:`.Model` is used to
build up a larger system by translating the unit cell to fill a certain shape or symmetry.
The model builds the Hamiltonian matrix by applying fields and other modifier parameters.
