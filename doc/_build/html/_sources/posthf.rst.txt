To begin a calculation with MoHa, the first step is to build a Hamiltonian of a 
system, either molecular system or model system. In most cases, we need to build a molecular
system

In terms of second quantisation operators, a general Hamiltonian can be written
as 

.. math::
        H = - \sum_{ij} t_{ij}\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{i}\hat{c}_{j} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ijkl}
        V_{ijkl}\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{i}\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{k}\hat{c}_{l}\hat{c}_{j}

The construction of molecular Hamiltonian usually set up in three steps. 

- First, construct a molecular geometry. 
- Second, generate a Gaussian basis set for the molecular.
- Finally, compute all kinds of one body terms and two body terms with that basis
  to define a Hamiltonian.
