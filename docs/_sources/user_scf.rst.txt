Hartree-Fock
############
The SCF procedure is the workhorse of most computational chemistry software packages, as it is generally the first step before doing more advanced calculations (such as MP2, etc).

Starting from the basics, we'll run a simple calculation for a water molecule with a bond-length of 1.1 Ã… and a bond angle of 104.0o with an STO-3G basis set.
