MoHa Overview
********************
In the last year, we are mainly focused on a new quantum chemistry package MoHa, which is the abbreviation of Molecular/Model Hamiltonian. MoHa is a general-purpose electronic structure program written in python that emphasizes code simplicity and facilitates new method development. The package provides the standard module including custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functionsï¼Œpost process for varieties properties. Besides the modules for a canonical module, MoHa also provides model Hamiltonian and Tensor network states method.
