MoHa
==================================

MoHa is abbreviation of *Mo*lecular&*Mo*del *Ha*miltonian, it is a quantum chemistry program written in python. MoHa now is
not a formal program but a toy for practice coding and help myself to have a better understanding of quantum chemistry.

For more information, visit MoHa's website: http://zhaoyilin.github.io/moha

The code is not really optimized, especially cause the moleculer integral are also written in python. It times few seconds for a water calculation with minimal basis at this stage. So it's now a toy.
